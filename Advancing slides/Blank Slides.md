### Blank Slides
#### How to use blank slides
Use a blank slide to indicate to the congregation when they should not be singing.

#### Intro
At the beginning of a song,
show the blank slide to indicate to the congregation that their participation is not expected at this time.
Some songs require this more than others.
Also be aware that some songs start immediately,
so there is no time for a blank slide.
Practice with the band during rehersal to fine-tune the timing of this.

#### Outro
The lyrics of a song are often done before the music,
and in such cases we use a blank slide to indicate to the congregation that their participation has ended.
After the congregation has sung the last slide,
and after you've shown any required legal notices,
advance to a blank slide while the band finishes playing.
(Note: you may also advance to the blank slide at the beginning of the next song, where appropriate.)

#### Intra-song gap
While this is the **Advancing Slides** section and not **Building Slides**,
the nature of blank slides is such that getting them correct pre-rehersal is impractical.
Thus, even if you didn't build the slides in general,
review the **Building Slides â€“ Blank slides** section for tips on determing if blank slides are appropriate for how this particular band is playing this particilar song on this particular day.
(Note: see **Pro Presenter tips** for guidance on how to adjust these slides live.)
