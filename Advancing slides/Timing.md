### How do we time slide advancement?
There's one thing that can cause trouble with singing faster than any other: bad slide timing!

So what is good timing?

#### Advance before people realize they want it
A key trick of doing slides well is to advance before people realize they need the slide advanced.
People tend to read ahead by a few words,
so you want to have the next slide ready for them *before* they sing it.
There are two main points to this:
1. Don't worry about cutting off a few words. People have already read them!
2. Because people are reading ahead, they need time to process the next words before they have to sing them.
There are two basic ways to count this: by word and by measure.

##### By word
If you're not musically inclined,
you may find it easier to advance slides based on a fixed amount of words left on the current slide.
It depends how fast they're playing, but generally about 3 words left is appropriate. 

##### By measure
If you know how to count music,
it can be more accurate to use measures to predict when you should change slides.
Generally, about 1.5 to 2 measures is an appropriate amount to pre-empt the next slide.

##### When NOT to advance early
Give heed to slower songs, or slides where there's a small gap between the phrases.
Also be wary of pre-advancing to a blank slide,
as that sends the signal that a congregation should stop singing before they're done with the verse.
In such cases, it's better to leave the current slide on screen for the whole duration rather than advance it early.
