### Blank slides
Why use blank slides?

Blank slides are useful to indicate to the congreation that they should not be singing.
As an extreme example, slides are not used for special music performed by one person or for instrumental music.
The message is clear: when there are no words on screen, you do not sing.

Stepping back from those extreme examples, we also use them in the middle of songs that otherwise invite participation at spots where such participation is not required.
Most commonly, this is an extended gap between two verses, or a bridge, or the begging or end of the song.

#### Gap between verses/sections
It's common for lyrical parts of a song to be separated with non-singing.
Sometimes this is just a brief pause, but sometimes the musicians will play 4 or more measures between the end of one verse and the beginning of the next one.
In these extended cases,
cutting to a blank slide indicates to the congregation that they're not expected to sing any time soon,
and they can relax and enjoy the music, close their eyes, pray,
or any number of other activities that are harder when they're expected to be actively reading and singing.
An exhaustive list of places in a song where this can occur is not possible, so use your judgement.
If there's ever an extended period of time where the congregation is not expected to participate,
consider a blank slide.

How long of a gap?

The answer to this question depends on many things, but primaryly on two:
musical time and clock time.
As a general rule of thumb, 4 measures of non-singing musical time is a good amount of space to use a blank slide,
and 2 measures is generally short enough to get away with not using a blank slide.
However, these numbers depend strongly how the tempo of the music, i.e., on how much clock time the musicians spend in this gap.
For example, 2 measures at 54BPM is very slow and you may feel that a blank slide is appropriate.
Similarly, 4 measures at 140BPM may feel rushed and inserting a blank slide may feel jarring and unnecessary.
There is no hard and fast rule, and the answer may change for the same song week-to-week depending on how the musicians are performing it.

#### Intro and outro slides
Songs should always have a begginging and ending slide that are completely without text, including only the background used for that presentation.
The purpose of these blank slides is to have a safe space inside that song to show when nothing else is appropraite.
Most commonly, the operator will sit on the first blank slide while the musicians are getting ready for a song,
and sometimes for a couple measures into the song during an instrumental section.
If the Confidence Monitor is configured correctly, sitting on this slide will show the title of the song on the Confidence Monitor,
which acts as a type of check to make sure the operator will show slides for the song the musicians are about to play.
With the intro blank slide selected,
the operator can easily use the arrow keys to start the slide progression.
If there is NOT a blank slide at the start,
the operator loses the ability to show the title on the Confidence Monitor,
and must use the mouse to select the title slide at the correct time.

### Punctuation
Not as much as you'd think!

### Repeating slides
Make it obvious that it's about to repeat!
