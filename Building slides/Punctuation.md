### Punctuation
If you're reading this wiki, chances are you care about language.
If you're anything like me, you might wish to obsessively add every comma, semicolon, period, and apostrophe that matches good grammar.
And most likely your slides would end up too noisy and distracting
and would be better if they were simpler.

Let's look at something with lots of proper punctuation

```
A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.
```

This text is technically correct,
which may be the best kind of correct,
but does not make for the best kind of slides.

You'll find this a lot especially with older hymns,
which tend to have long and complex sentences that are meaningful but read more like one of Paul's epistles than a Dr Seuss poem.
The commas, semicolons, and periods at the end of lines are distracting and should be removed.
Much better is something like this

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing
our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
```

Notice we leave the comma in the middle of the line
("our helper he, amid the flood")
but take out the end-of-line punctuation.
The reason is simple: ending the line acts as its punctuation, and the subtle difference between a comma and a semicolon can be easily glossed over by using a line break for everything.
There is still a need to differentiate between small and large gaps,
and for that we use slide breaks vs line breaks. Read more about that in [Slide breaks](Slide%20breaks.md)
