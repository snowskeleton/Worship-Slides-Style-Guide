# Slide breaks

When do we break a slide?
Broadly speaking, we split slides on 2, 3, or 4 lines,
sometimes branching out to 1 or 5,
technically 0 with [Blank slides](Blank%20slides),
and never 6 or more.

Let's look at our favorite hymn and explore a few of these options.

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing
our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
```

We have 9 lines to break up here, and a few ways we can go about it.
I find 4 lines is a good default, so let's see how that looks.

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing
our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
```

Not bad! We have to expand to 5 lines on the second slide, but that's not the end of the world.
Due to the timing between the last 5 lines,
I don't love splitting them into some combination of 3 and 2.
The lines are sung so close together that there's not really a good breaking point, so it's smoother just to have the extra line on screen.
Also, it's good to maintain consistency between slides in a song;
if one group of slides is 2s and 3s, and another is 4s and 5s, it gives the slides a mismatched feeling.

However, there's another approach we could take.
The first 4 lines often are sung with a short break between the 2nd and 3rd line,
so we could split them like so

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing

our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
```

Doing this opens up the option of splitting the second half into 2 and 3 lines each, giving us a total of four slides like so

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing

our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe

his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
```

There's still the tension of not having a great split in the last three lines,
but building slides is always a game of compromise.
If the band has a such a long gap between the first two slides that you don't feel comfortable combining them,
then splitting the last section into two slides helps match the style of the first two.

Our slides still aren't complete, though.
