# Capitalization
Let's look at our favorite hymn again,
and for arguments sake we'll leave it as two total slides

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing
our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
```

This is a great start, but the lines need some help.
Specifically, we need to capitalize them.
Lines of music are like poetry,
and it's often the style in poetry to capitalize the start of the line even if that word otherwise wouldn't warrant a capital letter.
Thus, we get this:

```
A mighty fortress is our God
A bulwark never failing
Our helper he, amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
Does seek to work us woe
His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate
On earth is not his equal
```

There's also the tradition of capitalizing words used for God,
which in this text could be anything from "his" (widely accepted)
to "mighty fortress", "bulkwark", and "helper" (less common).
Typically I aim for the more widely accepted capitalization,
but capitalize how the spirit is leading you.
For example, I often see "Sun of Righteousness" capitalized,
as that is a name used in scripture for Jesus,
and thus somehow more official than "mighty fortress".
A middle road approach leaves us with this:

```
A mighty fortress is our God
A bulwark never failing
Our helper He, amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
Does seek to work us woe
His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate
On earth is not his equal
