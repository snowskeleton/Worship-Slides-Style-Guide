# Capitalization
Let's look at our favorite hymn again,
and for arguments sake we'll leave it as two total slides

```
A mighty fortress is our God
a bulwark never failing
our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
does seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
```

This is a great start, but the lines need some help.
Specifically, we need to capitalize them.
Lines of music are like poetry,
and it's often the style in poetry to capitalize the start of the line even if that word otherwise wouldn't warrant a capital letter.
Thus, we get this:

```
A mighty fortress is our God
A bulwark never failing
Our helper he, amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
Does seek to work us woe
His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate
On earth is not his equal
```
