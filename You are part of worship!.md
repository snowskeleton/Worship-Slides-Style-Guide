## You are part of worship!
It may not feel like it, but your job is every bit as important as the musicians on stage, and sometimes more! If a musician plays a wrong note, people can keep singing. But if you don't advance the slide? People are completely lost.

In lesser ways, having poorly formatted slides can cause confusion in the congregation, which gets in the way of singing. Poorly laid out slides can also make them hard to advance well, which makes it more likely you'll slip up.
